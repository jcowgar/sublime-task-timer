# Sublime Task Timer

A plugin created for Sublime to time simple tasks such as how long
it takes to fix a given bug. When work begins on a task, run
the command `Task Timer: Start Timer`. Any time you wish to determine
how long the timer has been running for, run the command
`Task Timer: Status`. If you wish to restart the timer at any given
moment, simply run the command `Task Timer: Start Timer` to restart
the timer.
